# Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 - Computer Control Agent

**Note: This project is currently very much work in progress.**


## ⚠️ Important Warning

**CAUTION: Do not run this project on your personal computer or any system containing sensitive information.**

This project is highly experimental and grants extensive control over the computer it runs on. It has the potential to perform unintended actions that could result in data loss, system instability, or security breaches. Only run this on a dedicated, isolated system specifically set up for testing purposes.

By using this software, you acknowledge the risks involved and accept full responsibility for any consequences that may arise from its use.


## Overview

This project implements an AI Agent capable of interacting with a computer system and performing various tasks. The agent is designed to understand and execute different actions based on user input and utilize various tools to accomplish its objectives.

### Key Features:

1. **Computer Interaction**: The agent can perform actions such as mouse clicks, keyboard input, and screen captures.
2. **Tool Integration**: The project includes a framework for integrating different tools, such as bash commands and text editing capabilities.
3. **Flexible Input Handling**: The agent can process various types of input, including text and tool results.
4. **Extensible Architecture**: The design allows for easy addition of new tools and actions.

## Current State

The project is under active development. Core functionalities like computer interaction and basic tool usage are implemented, while others (like bash commands and text editing) are planned for future development.

## Usage (Don't do this)

Currently, the project can be run as a script, with an example usage provided in the `main.py` file. The agent can be initialized and invoked with a payload, demonstrating its ability to process and respond to user input.

## Future Development

- Implementation of bash command tool
- Text editor tool integration
- Expansion of computer interaction capabilities
- Enhanced error handling and feedback mechanisms

## Contribution

As this project is in its early stages, contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. Please note that the codebase is subject to significant changes as development progresses.
